Now THIS, is a stupid repo.

All it does it update itself at least once a day with the time at the moment of update. It does this a random number of times per day, at a random time during hours when someone might be working.

## Why?

Because people believe a busy coder is a good coder. So having regular commits looks good. That's why they're little green squares on your github profile. And if you have green squares on the weekend? When you're supposed to be spending time with your loved ones? Phew, you must be a real power house. Green means good, and the more commits you have, the greener your squares become, and the good-er you must be.

## Wait, what?

Basically, what I'm trying to say is that more is not always better, and greener is not always good-er. To prove it, I made a public, recurring github workflow that reminds itself what time it is a couple times per day, so I don't have to check.

Fork it for yourself, and let your profile gleam with green.
